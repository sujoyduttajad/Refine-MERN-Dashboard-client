Basically, Evoia is a property-management app that allows agents to create, update, and delete properties, add agents, reviews to the properties and chat with other agents or potential customers. Apart from the CRUD operation this app is also a Dashboard to the agents which shows the Total assests, Top agents, latest sales, customers, and property influence in a graphical and interactive way.

The app is live here and feel free to check it out -
