Basically, Evoia is a property-management app that allows agents to create, update, and delete properties, add agents, reviews to the properties and chat with other agents or potential customers. Apart from the CRUD operation this app is also a Dashboard to the agents which shows the Total assests, Top agents, latest sales, customers, and property influence in a graphical and interactive way.

The app is live here and feel free to check it out -

If you like it please make sure to support me by hitting the star icon. Also it would be great if visitors create new properties this gives a hands on experience to users and also give me a lot of data to work on. **Please don't add any unnecessary/crucial information** Follow the guide in Help & Info page. 

The app has server and client side, the server is deployed separately and client on Vercel
