Future enhancements will include in-app messaging, enabling seamless communication between agents and potential clients. With Evoia, managing properties isn’t just easier—it’s smarter. 🚀

Also, it would be great if visitors create new properties this gives a hands-on experience to users and also gives me a lot of data to work on. **Please don't add any unnecessary/crucial information** Follow the guide on the Help & Info page.
